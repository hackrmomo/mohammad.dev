# mohammad.dev

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is all of the code that runs my website, mohammad.dev. It's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and hosted on [my home server](https://github.com/hackrmomo/home_server) as a dockerized container. It's a work in progress, so expect great things to come!

## Development
To run this project locally, you'll need to have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed. Then, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```
sudo docker-compose up -d
# or to do a clean deployment
sudo docker-compose up -d --build --force-recreate --remove-orphans
```
